/**
 * Asset metadata types for the ZK Payroll SDK.
 *
 * These types define a consistent metadata shape for any asset (native XLM,
 * Soroban tokens, custom stablecoins) used across payroll operations.
 *
 * ## Design goals
 *
 * - Centralise display-time concerns (decimals, symbol, label) in one place
 *   so that callers never hard-code them across the app.
 * - Keep identifiers simple: an asset is keyed by its contract ID string for
 *   Soroban tokens, or by the reserved string `"native"` for XLM.
 * - Remain extensible: the `customData` escape hatch lets apps attach
 *   protocol-specific context without touching the core types.
